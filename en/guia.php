                            For national security reasons, the Mexican federal constitution prohibits non-Mexican
                            persons from owning real estate located within 30 miles of Mexico's coastline, referred to
                            as the "restricted zone". All of Baja California Sur and all other desirable coastal lands

                            zone. In the early 1970s, the Mexican government wanted to encourage foreign investment and
                            began allowing foreigners to purchase coastal property through a "fideicomiso" or trust
                            contract. The coastal property is held in trust by a Mexican bank. The bank acts on behalf
                            of the foreign buyer, taking title to the property. The bank then has a fiduciary obligation
                            to follow the instructions given by the foreign buyer. Contrary to a land lease, as
                            beneficiary of the trust, the foreign buyer enjoys all the rights of full ownership and may
                            sell, give away, lease, add buildings, improve existing buildings, mortgage and encumber the

                            notary public in order to be valid. Once the promissory note or trust is drawn up, the buyer
                            has the right to choose a notary public to close the transaction. In some planned
